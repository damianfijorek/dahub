# Single page application that displays a list of GitHub users

Users are fetched using the GitHub Search API because it supports regular pagination. For Users API I would use either _load more_ or _infinite scroll_ approach. Requests are made using `axios` HTTP client. User interface is made with Ant Design Components. `HashRouter` is used to have working router on refresh.

Redux store is used to keep page and page size when user go back from details page. Users list is not in the store. It would be nice, but I had to stop somewhere. ðŸ˜‰ In addition I migth not be up to date with Redux because lately I used just React Context instead. Please let me know if it's any good. ðŸ˜Š

Request are not authenticated thus there is limit of 10 request per minute. Be cool. ðŸ˜Ž Wait one minute if you get the _API rate limit exceeded..._ toast.
